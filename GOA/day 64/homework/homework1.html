            <p>Mercedes was the 1st company to patent the automobile in 1885. Mercedes was light years ahead of the competition and produced the first hybrid car, gasoline and electric, in 1906. This was subsequently dropped in favour of entirely gasoline-fossil fuel-powered vehicles.</p>

            First car of Mercedes-benz

        <div>
            <p>Mercedes-Benz's first car was the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, created by Karl Benz in 1886. This vehicle is widely regarded as the first true automobile because it was powered by an internal combustion engine. It had a lightweight design with three wheels and a rear-mounted single-cylinder engine. The car was capable of reaching a top speed of about 16 km/h (10 mph).</p>
